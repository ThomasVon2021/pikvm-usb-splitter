# USB/PWR Splitter

## 1. Introduction

The adaptor allows the Raspberry Pi 4 to be used with a Pi USB-C power supply while allowing access to USB OTG data over a separate USB-C connection.

USB-C (RPI4) <> USB-C (USB) and USB-C (PWR)

| USB-C(RPI4)   | USB Type-C(USB) | USB Type-C(PWR) |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 5V            |                 | 5V              |
| D-            | D-              |                 |
| D+            | D+              |                 |
| CC1 10k to 5V | CC1 5.1k to GND | CC1 5.1k to GND |
| CC2 10k to 5V | CC2 5.1k to GND | CC2 5.1k to GND |
| GND           | GND             | GND             |

To use the adaptor with the Raspberry Pi 4 you need.

- USB-C to USB-C cable[1] between Pi4 and the adaptor board
- USB-C to USB-C or Type-A between adaptor board and PC
- Power[2] via Official Raspberry Pi USB Type-C Power Supply.

[1] Whilst USB-C cables are generally designed for higher current I still advise using short power cable to the Pi where possible to reduce voltage drop.

[2] **PLEASE NOTE** With the Pu/Pd resistors on this board it can only be used with 5V supply to power a 5V device.

An adaptor of this kind does not fall within the USB specification. It's designed for use with the official Raspberry Pi USB-C power supply and raspberry pi, use with other power supplies/chargers and devices may cause issues/damage.
